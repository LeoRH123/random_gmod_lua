# subwaysurftest

this is basically a predecessor to LK3D i made attempting to make a small 3d subway surfers clone that i could fit as an easteregg into a gmod server i used to dev on, never really did anything with it but it inspired LK3D

## How to run
install it as legacy addon and on any map, run `lua_openscript_cl surf-main.lua`


## misc nfo
the code is terrible as i wrote it

excluding suzanne and the cube, i made all of the models in blender

this actually calculates all of the 3d stuff in lua, only using a gmod func to render the triangles, unlike LK3D which takes advantage of mesh. functions to use your gpu (if using hardware renderer)
  
this also has a really broken sound generator thing?
